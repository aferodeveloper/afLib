While we're eager and able to help porting afLib to other MCU platforms, the porting process itself is not particularly complex for you if you are familiar at all with your MCU platform - which you probably already are!

A wholesale Afero request of "please port afLib to the XXX MCU" will possibly be a chargeable service - or included in engineering or support hours in an existing business relationship with us, but requests along the lines of "I'm porting afLib to the XXX MCU and I have some questions/need a little assistance/etc" will be handled to the best of our abilities.

Please see the afLib Porting Guide document on https://developer.afero.io/ for more information.
